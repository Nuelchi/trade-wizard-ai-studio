# Next.js Migration Progress

## âœ… Completed Steps

1. **Fixed TypeScript errors** in Supabase edge functions
2. **Created Next.js configuration** with proper path aliases
3. **Set up basic Next.js structure** with App Router
4. **Converted Home page** to Next.js format (app/page.tsx)
5. **Created non-auth page routes** for testing:
   - `/test` â†’ Enhanced Test page
   - `/marketplace` â†’ Marketplace page  
   - `/pricing` â†’ Pricing page
   - `/learn` â†’ Learn page
6. **Updated Navigation component** to use Next.js Link instead of React Router

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

The Next.js setup is ready for **proof of concept testing**. You can now test the non-auth pages by:

1. Running the current Vite app (port 8080): `npm run dev`
2. Testing individual Next.js pages by accessing them directly

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Non-Auth Pages
- [ ] Update all React Router links in components to Next.js Link
- [ ] Test all non-auth page functionality 
- [ ] Fix any SSR-related issues
- [ ] Ensure all UI components work with Next.js

### Phase 2: Authentication Pages
- [ ] Convert Dashboard page to Next.js
- [ ] Update authentication flow for Next.js
- [ ] Convert My Strategies page
- [ ] Convert Account page

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- [ ] Remove React Router dependencies
- [ ] Update all remaining components
- [ ] Test complete application
- [ ] Deploy Next.js version

## ðŸ”§ Running Both Versions

- **Vite version** (current): `npm run dev` (port 8080)
- **Next.js version** (new): Use the package-nextjs.json for dependencies

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues

1. Some components still use React Router hooks
2. Context providers may need updates for SSR
3. localStorage usage needs client-side checks
4. Theme toggling needs Next.js theme provider updates

The migration is progressing well and the foundation is solid for a complete conversion to Next.js with SSR capabilities.
